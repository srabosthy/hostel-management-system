<u><h1>Hostel For Students</h1>
<br><br>

<h3>It is said that home is sweet. But even then life at home cannot be compared to the life in a hostel.
At home one has to live as other members of the family live. Elders are always there to check the activities of youngsters. 
One cannot even frame one's own timetable of studies. One has to keep in mind the convenience of others.
 One has to study while others keep on talking and gossiping. Often one room, one kerosene lantern or lamp is used jointly by two or three brothers and sisters. 
 If some relative or guest comes in, the whole program of studies is upset. In fact, at home there is no atmosphere for serious studies. 
 There is constant disturbance due to one reason or the other. </h3>
